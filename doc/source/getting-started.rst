Getting Started
===============

Cue is comprised of three cue components :ref:`cue-api`, supported by a few standard open source components.

There are many different options for customizing Cue, and two of these options
have a major impact on the installation process:

* The storage backend used (SQLite or MySQL)

This guide will walk you through setting up a typical development environment for Cue.

For this guide you will need access to an Ubuntu Server (14.04).  Other platforms:

- `Fedora 19 Notes`_

.. _Development Environment:

Development Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Installing Cue
==============

.. index::
   double: install; cue

1. Install system package dependencies (Ubuntu)

::

   $ apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv
   $ apt-get build-dep python-lxml

2. Clone the Cue repo from GitHub

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/stackforge/cue.git
   $ cd cue


3. Setup virtualenv

.. note::
   This is an optional step, but will allow Cue's dependencies
   to be installed in a contained environment that can be easily deleted
   if you choose to start over or uninstall Cue.

::

   $ virtualenv --no-site-packages .venv
   $ . .venv/bin/activate


4. Install Cue and its dependencies

::

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt -r test-requirements.txt
   $ python setup.py develop


5. Change directories to the etc/cue folder.

.. note::
    Everything from here on out should take place in or below your cue/etc folder

::

   $ cd etc/cue


6. Create Cue's config files by copying the sample config files

::

   $ ls *.sample | while read f; do cp $f $(echo $f | sed "s/.sample$//g"); done


7. Make the directory for Cue log files

::

   $ mkdir /var/log/cue


Configuring Cue
===============

.. index::
    double: configure; cue

Open the cue.conf file for editing

::

  $ editor cue.conf


Copy or mirror the configuration from this sample file here:

.. literalinclude:: examples/example-cue.conf
    :language: ini

Installing MySQL
================

.. index::
    double: install; mysql

Install the MySQL server package

::

    $ apt-get install mariadb-server


If you do not have MySQL previously installed, you will be prompted to change the root password.
By default, the MySQL root password for Cue is "password". You can:

* Change the root password to "password"
* If you want your own password, edit the cue.conf file and change any instance of
   "mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/cue" to "mysql://root:YOUR_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1/cue"

You can change your MySQL password anytime with the following command::

    $ mysqladmin -u root -p password NEW_PASSWORD
    Enter password <enter your old password>

Create the Cue and PowerDNS tables

::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password: <enter your password here>

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE `cue` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    mysql> exit;


Install additional packages

::

    $ apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
    $ pip install mysql-python


If you intend to run Cue as a non-root user, then sudo permissions need to be granted

::

   $ echo "cue ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/90-cue
   $ sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/90-cue


Initialize & Start the API Service
==================================

.. index::
   double: install; api

::

   #Sync the Cue database:
   $ cue-manage --config-file etc/cue/cue.conf database upgrade

   #Start the api service:
   $ cue-api --config-file etc/cue/cue.conf

You'll now be seeing the log from the api service.


Exercising the API
==================

.. note:: If you have a firewall enabled, make sure to open port 53, as well as Cue's default port (6385).

Using a web browser, curl statement, or a REST client, calls can be made to the Cue API using the following format where “command” is any of the commands listed in the :doc:`rest`

You can find the IP Address of your server by running

::

   wget http://ipecho.net/plain -O - -q ; echo


Fedora 19 Notes
===============

Most of the above instructions under `Installing Cue`_ should work.  There are a few differences when working with Fedora 19:

Installing Cue on Fedora
------------------------

Installing the basic Fedora packages needed to install Cue:

::

   $ yum install gcc git yum-utils
   $ yum install python-pip python-virtualenv python-pbr
   $ yum-builddep python-lxml

Use **/var/lib/cue** as the root path for databases and other variable state files, not /root/cue

::

   $ mkdir -p /var/lib/cue

Installing MySQL
----------------

The MySQL Fedora packages are **mysql mysql-server mysql-devel**

::

    $ yum install mysql mysql-server mysql-devel
    $ pip install mysql-python

You will have to change the MySQL password manually.

::

    $ systemctl start mysqld.service
    $ mysqladmin -u root password NEW_PASSWORD
        # default password for Cue is 'password'

::
